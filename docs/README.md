This is my research journal of various topics that I'm interested in for my research. My research is mostly in using Machine learning methods in various applications of remote sensing and climate sciences. The predominant algorithms of interest include kernel methods like Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Invertible Flows like Rotation-Based Iterative Gaussianization (RBIG) for density and dependence estimation.

### [**My Talks**](talks/README.md)

> Some talks that I have done along with code and slides.

### [**My Resources**](resources/README.md)

> My resources for all things python and tech. I like to tinker with different packages so I try to document my findings.


### [**My Projects**](projects/README.md)

> My projects that I am involved in mostly related to academia.


### [**My Thesis**](thesis/README.md)

> My Thesis and everything related to it. I decided to compile all of my notes in markdown and of course the final product will be available in LaTeX format.

### [**My Tutorials**](tutorials/README.md)

> I do like to give back to the community. So I have compiled some tutorials that will hopefully be helpful to other people.

### [**My Snippets**](snippets/README.md)

> I write lots of bits of code everywhere and it tends to be disorganized. I'm trying to organize my bits of code everywhere into digestable snippets; kind of like a personal reference.
